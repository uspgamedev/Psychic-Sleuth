The first case
==============

Intro
-----

"D": Detective
"M": Man
"W": Woman
"V": The victim

[D]
It was a windy afternoon, and a few months had passed since my last job. Afraid
that I could-ve got a little rusty, I picked up an easy-looking one. By the way,
the name is Bobdude, and I`m a supernatural detective. I try to keep it a secret
though. I hope I don`t have to use my power in this case.

(Goes into the house)

[D]
"Hello there. Did anyone call for a private detective?"
I could hear the sobs of a woman in the distance. I strong
looking man came from upstairs.

[M]
"Welcome, I`m Big Guy. My wife, Crybaby Lady, is shocked and won`t leave her room.
I hope you understand."

[D]
"Of course".
Humm. This definetly looks like it is going to be easy.
"If you excuse me, then, I shal begin right away."

[M]
"Sure. I will show you to Hipster Guy. He is the victim."
Said the big man, before leading me to his office.

[D]
Humm. Trauma to the back of the head. Intense bleeding. Looks like a
blunt weapon caused this. Which is bad, since a lot of things in a
house could cause blunt damage. *Finding the murder weapon is crucial.*
"How did you find him?"

[M]
"He was like that *when I left the shower*. I looked for Crybaby but she
seemed as surprised as me. We then decide to call for your services to avoid
any unnecessary scandals."

[D]
"I see."
There is something very fishy about that statement.
"Is anybody else here?"

[M]
"No, just my wife and me. We locked the house down until you arrived..."

[D]
"I see."
So *either he or his wife must be the culprit*.
"Mind if I take a look around?"

[M]
"Not at all."
He was looking very serious for such a carefree answer.

[D]
Let`s check this crime scene, and then the other rooms. I must
click on the objects I find intriguing or suspicious to find evidence.
Hopefully, those will lead me to the motive. *With both whydunnit and the
howdunnit, I can uncover the whodunnit*.

Once I`m done here, I just have to click on the *WALK ICON* and move
to another room.

Office events
-------------

- PC

[D]
You can find out a lot about people from their PCs. For instance,
reading these e-mail from Crybaby Lady (which I just hacked) reveals
to me that she was having an affair with Hipster Guy. But apparently
they argued about something and should have been on bad terms before
the murder. I really want to know what she has to say about this.

- Tool Box

[D]
An old tool box. Every house needs one.
<if CARPENTER>

* Bedroom

- News on the wall

[D]
Some news about Big Guy building the most awesome treehouse in the
neighbourhood. He must be really good with tools.

- Talking to Crybaby Lady

<< no flags >>

[W]
"Sob, sob... How could this happen..."

[D]
"It will be OK, miss. Could you tell me how it happened?"

[W]
"I didn`t see any of it.. sob.. I just.. Big Guy came in shouting
that something happend to Hipster Guy, and then I saw all that blood..."
She froze there and stared into nowhere.

[D]
"Lady?"

[W]
"That's it. I came back here and my husband hugged me. It felt weird,
because it was both conforting and accusing... Like he pitied me. *With
everything that I`d done, I did not know how to feel*."
